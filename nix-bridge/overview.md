# Overview

In August, 2020, The NIX Platform announced intentions to build a bridge between Ethereum and NIX in cooperation with The Blockchain Foundry in order to bring zero knowledge proof interoperability within and across entire blockchains and assets.

The bridge will consist of 2 tokens, NBT and NGT.

NBT, the NIX Bridge Token, is the primary foundation for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\) and will help to provide the funding required to develop the bridge. This DAO will include the elaboration of utility tools, web wallet, DEX development, marketing campaigns and liquidity allocation.

Though Ethereum will be the first to be bridged, development is being done in a modular way so as to allow any tokenized platform to be easily added in the future. Furthermore, the ultimate goal is to provide a full zero-knowledge proof based DEX directly on NIX similar to Uniswap.

A simple comparison for this would be to think of NIX being ETH \(used for gas\) and NBT as UNI.
