# NIX Ghost Token \(NGT\)

## In Development

NGT, the NIX Ghost Token represents privatized assets on the native NIX Platform blockchain. Once wrapped, individual assets \(NGT-LINK for example\) can be privately moved and traded. Minting and burning of NGT based assets are handled by supported Ghostnodes.
