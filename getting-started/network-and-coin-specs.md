| Current Supply | ~47,400,000 \(SEP 2020\) |
| Maximum Supply | 102,210,160 \(After 40 years\) |

| Ghostnode Vault to Vault TX Fee \*\* \(2-way Ghosting\) | .1 Ghosted NIX |

\*- Node rewards are paid to 1 Ghostnode at a time, repeatedly cycling through the list of active nodes. Currently, this means a Ghostnode owner can expect 2 rewards per day \(16.896 NIX\).  
\*\*- Vault fees are pooled and split among all active Ghostnodes on a daily basis.

## Inflation/Halving Schedule

Staking rewards are not subject to scheduled reductions, but instead, slowly increase over time until the maximum supply is reached.

Ghostnode and Development rewards are halved every 4 years, with the first one expected to happen in June/July 2022.

Overall inflation is approximately 3 million NIX per year.
