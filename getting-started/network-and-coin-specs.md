# Network and Coin Specs

{% hint style="danger" %}
All users must unghost any privatized funds before the chainswap takes place in the near future. Failure to do so will result in the complete loss of privatized funds! Privacy functions will be reintroduced in the update following the chainswap.

### Coin

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Current Supply | ~47,850,000 \(NOV 2020\) |
| Maximum Supply | 102,210,160 \(After 40 years\) |
| Staking Reward | ~2.7 per block |
| Development Fund | 1.28 per block |
| Ghostnode Reward \* | 8.448 per block |
| Ghostnode Ghost Vault Fee \*\* \(1-way Ghosting\) | .25% |
| Ghostnode Vault to Vault TX Fee \*\* \(2-way Ghosting\) | .1 Ghosted NIX |

\*- Node rewards are paid to 1 Ghostnode at a time, repeatedly cycling through the list of active nodes. Currently, this means a Ghostnode owner can expect 2 rewards per day \(16.896 NIX\).  
\*\*- Vault fees are pooled and split among all active Ghostnodes on a daily basis.

### Inflation/Halving Schedule

Staking rewards are not subject to scheduled reductions, but instead, slowly increase over time until the maximum supply is reached at a rate of 1.5% per year.

Ghostnode and Development rewards are halved every 4 years, with the first one expected to happen in June/July 2022.

Overall inflation is approximately 3 million NIX per year.
