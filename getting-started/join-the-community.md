# Join the Community

If you want to get involved with the community, you should consider [joining the NIX Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/HGuvDTW). Most of the development discussion takes place in there so it's our strongest and busiest social presence. You can also catch some free NIX from our rain bot by participating in the Discord \#ghost-squad chat!

Here's the full list of ways to connect - we'd love your support on all of our social platforms!
