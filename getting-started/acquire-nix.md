## Offering LPoS Services

With NIX's [**Leased Proof of Stake**](../wallet-functionality/staking/leaded-staking-lpos/) ****it is possible for users to lease coins to third-party merchants to stake for them. These staking providers may take a fee for their services.

## Becoming a NIX Merchant

Every eCommerce merchant is now able to accept NIX as payment currency. To make this more accessible, NIX is featured on [**SwirlPay**](https://swirlpay.io/assets/) ****and also released an [**Add-On for WooCommerce**](https://github.com/NixPlatform/cryptowoo-nix-addon).
