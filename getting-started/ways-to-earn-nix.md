# Ways to Earn NIX

There are several avenues of earning NIX by participating in the NIX ecosystem.   
  
Those include receiving tips from our Discord tip bot, rewards and fees from a Ghostnode, rewards from staking your coins, becoming an LPoS Merchant and accepting NIX as payment for eCommerce transactions.  
  
Bounties and giveaways may also be available at various times, so please monitor our announcements for future initiatives. 

## Discord Rain and Tip Bot

Join the [NIX Discord chat server](https://discordapp.com/invite/HGuvDTW) and catch some rain and tips from other users by participating in the \#ghost-squad chat.

## Ghostnode Rewards

[Ghostnodes](ghostnodes.md) receive a percentage of all block rewards as well as privacy transaction fees.

## Staking Rewards

NIX is [Proof of Stake](consensus.md) \(PoS\) coin and allows holders of any amount to stake their coins in order to receive rewards. You can either stake your coins directly from your own supported wallets or easily create a smart contract with an [LPoS provider](https://nixplatform.io/marketplace).

## Offering LPoS Services

With NIX's Leased Proof of Stake \(LPoS\), you can [host and maintain a service](../support/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos/lpos-server-installation.md) which will allow you to stake coins on the behalf of other people for which you can collect a percentage of the rewards as a fee.

## Accept NIX for Merchant Services

Every eCommerce merchant is now able to accept NIX as payment currency. To make this more accessible, NIX is featured on [**SwirlPay**](https://swirlpay.io/assets/) ****and has also released an [**Add-On for WooCommerce**](https://github.com/NixPlatform/cryptowoo-nix-addon).
