# Overview of NIX Wallets

## Available Wallets

The following wallets are currently available for download; QT, UI, Electrum, SPV Mobile and CLI. 

The QT and UI wallets are both based on NIX Core meaning they share the same daemon and wallet.dat \(if the default installation directory is preserved\) whereas the Electrum and SPV wallets are separate entities. 

This means you can have both the QT and UI wallets installed on the same machine giving the user access to the slick UI interface for every day tasks as well as the fully featured QT wallet as needed. For a comparison see:
