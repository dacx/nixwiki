# Governance Proposals

NIX incorporated its decentralized off-chain governance system on May 25th, 2019. Creating an off-chain governance model allows for a light-weight method of governance by ensuring that users who secure the network have a say in the direction NIX takes. This system prevents unnecessary blockchain data storage while at the same time maintaining transparency.

Whether you are an individual community member suggesting a change in operations or a company looking to exchange services for compensation \(or any combination thereof\), this is the place to do it.

**Once properly submitted, there are 2 requirements that must be met in order for a proposal to pass:**

1. At least 50% of all eligible votes are cast.
2. At least 75% of cast votes are in favor.

## Creating A Proposal

The current fee for creating a proposal is 50 NIX, which is to be sent to the NIX development fund address nix1qr7y5gtwrpuadsluk7v2wdn9pwx3s4asf25hcq2

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTICE:** Be sure that exactly 50 NIX is sent to the development fund address by **not** subtracting the network fee from the transaction amount!
{% endhint %}

After sending the fee, point your web browser to the [proposal submission page](https://governance.nixplatform.io/#/submit) and fill in the submission form. This includes:

* Your name or a title for your proposal
* Your NIX address for receiving payment
* Requested amount of payment
* The transaction ID for the 50 NIX proposal fee payment

Proposals should be submitted after at least 3 confirmations of your fee payment. Proposal submission fees are irreversible and there will be no refunding for spam proposals of any kind.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TIP:** You can request your payment to be paid as a fixed amount of NIX or fiat equivalency at the time your requested payment is sent. If, for example, youâ€™d rather be compensated with a USD value in NIX, please make sure that requirement is explicitly stated in your proposal.
{% endhint %}

### Tips to get your proposal to pass

By making a submission you are presenting a proposal of improvement to the project stakeholders and/or tendering for development funds. As such, successful proposals are likely to have been well thought out and presented in a clear manner. In the event that your proposal description is too long for the submission form, simply provide an external link for more details.

Consider joining the \#governance [Discord server chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/HGuvDTW) and discussing your idea with the community first. This can help give you an initial reaction and level of interest, along with helping to formulate and refine your idea so that it has the best possible chance to succeed.

Get the word out on your proposal via social media channels.
