# Feature Requests

Feature requests are best submitted in exactly the same manner as [Wallet Issues](how-to-log-an-issue.md) within the appropriate [NIXPlatform GitHub repository](https://github.com/NixPlatform). This will ensure that your idea is seen by the development team.

Simply open a new issue and describe the feature you'd like to see added. A developer may then add the "enhancement" label to your post to differentiate it from other issues/bugs.
