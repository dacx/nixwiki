# Server Side

The server side of the Ghostnode is what actually does all of the work. As such, it needs to remain running uninterrupted in order to maximize your rewards. A VPS or dedicated hosting service is strongly recommended.  
  
All funds are contained on the client side, so the user always has full control over their funds.
