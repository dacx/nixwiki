# Hosting Services

There are several services that offer to host your Ghostnode for you. The major advantage of using a hosting service is that they will maintain server side updates and security for you. Please note that this list may not include every available provider, nor are any of them endorsed by the NIX team.

Each hosting service will have step by step instructions on how to setup and deploy your Ghostnode using their specific platform.

If you know of a provider not on this list, please let a team member know about it so we can add them!
