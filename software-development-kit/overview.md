# Overview

The NIX SDK allows developers to interact and build on top of the NIX Platform by using the cross-platform JavaScript language. Based on the bitcoin-core SDK, using nix-core is no different with the exception of NIX-specific commands and capabilities.

Requirements include a running instance of the NIX daemon which serves are your gateway to the network and the SDK package itself. [Initial setup instructions](initial-setup.md) are available along with a basic daemon configuration example.

Once an active connection is established, all available NIX RPC commands may be executed. An example and list of commonly used commands are provided in the brief [Usage Guide](usage-guide.md). More examples can be found in the SDK documentation.
