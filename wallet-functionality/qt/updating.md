# Installation and Updating

Download the latest release for your specific Operating System via the [NIX website](https://nixplatform.io/wallet#download) or direct from [GitHub](https://github.com/NixPlatform/NixCore/releases). For MacOS and Windows, simply click on the .exe/.dmg file to begin installation. For all others, unpack the .tar.gz or .zip file and copy the binary/executable files to the appropriate location to install for all users, or simply execute them from where ever you unpacked them if no other users need access.

## Release Differences

### ARM

#### nix-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz

ARM processors are extensively used in consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, multimedia players and other mobile devices, such as wearables. Because of their reduced instruction set, they require fewer transistors, which enables a smaller die size for the integrated circuitry \(IC\). Chances are slim this is the release you are looking for.

#### nix-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

AArch64 is the name for the new 64-bit ARM architecture, also known as ARMv8 or ARM64. Hardware designed for this hardware specification is new, and still developing. Chances are slim this is the release you are looking for.

### Source Code

If you wish to compile the binary/executable files yourself, the source code is available in .zip and .tar.gz compressed file formats. Note that you will also need to have all required and optional dependencies already installed in order to successfully compile from source code.
