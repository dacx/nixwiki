# Staking

The NIX QT Wallet allows users to stake their holdings directly as well as giving them the ability to create contracts that allow your coins to be staked by a secondary wallet without ever giving up control of your funds. While LPoS contracts typically involve a merchant who often charges a small fee, users can also lease coins to themselves in order to stake from a wallet that doesn't have the ability to move or send coins in the event that the PC becomes compromised with something such as a keylogger. It also allows users the ability to safely stake from a VPS without the worry of a higher level admin being able to take control of your wallet funds.
