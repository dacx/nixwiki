# Backup and Security

## Backup and Recovery

The Flare mobile wallet uses a 12 word seed phrase that will be displayed once you first open/create your wallet. Simply write down the list of words and store them in a safe place. **It is strongly recommended that you do not store them electronically**. Without these words \(and in the proper order\), recovery is not possible. 

These 12 words can recover your NIX wallet if used in any BIP32/39 compliant wallet that supports NIX.

To view your seed phrase at any time, tap "Settings" in the bottom menu bar, followed by "View Mnemonic".

## Security

Security on mobile devices include both device level security along with in-app security. Installing the app to a locked phone is highly recommended. Additionally, the app itself is further secured with a password. You can reset your Flare Mobile password by tapping on "Settings" in the bottom menu bar, followed by "Reset Password"
