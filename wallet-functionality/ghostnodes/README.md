# Ghostnodes

To set up your own Ghostnode, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. 40,000 NIX
2. A VPS with at least 1GB of RAM 

Create a new G address in your wallet by typing **getnewaddress GN1 ghostnode** into your [wallet console](../console-commands.md). Proceed to send exactly **40000 NIX** there \(_do not tick subtract fee from amount in the sending screen_\).

Afterwards, enter **ghostnode outputs** into your wallet to get the output needed for all other steps.

You can now proceed with either the [automated one-click installers](ghost-node-setup.md) or look through the [other install methods](other-install-methods.md).
