# Ghost Vault

The NIX Ghost Vault feature is a technology that provides privacy to either the sender or the receiver. NIX are not directly stored into the vault, as they are first minted into zerocoins by the implementation of the optional privacy Ghost Protocol. Userâ€™s minted zerocoins are combined into an accumulator, thus eliminating the possibility of identifying which coins belong to each user.

The Ghost Vault became available for use on the network at block 53,000.
