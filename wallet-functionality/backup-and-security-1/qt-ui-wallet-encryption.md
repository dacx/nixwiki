# QT/UI Wallet Encryption

Encrypting your wallet.dat file will require that you enter a password in order to send any NIX. It is also a requirement if you wish to stake your NIX directly from your own wallet. 

Although you can perform this action at any time, it is best to do it immediately upon starting a new wallet and before generating/using any receive addresses. More information on why can be found in the [Wallet Backup](wallet-backup.md) article.

## QT Wallet

From the Settings menu, select "Encrypt Wallet..." to begin the process of encrypting your wallet.dat file.

![Confirm that you wish to encrypt your wallet](../../.gitbook/assets/qt-confirmencryption.png)

Please note: After confirming you wish to encrypt your wallet, it may take a few moments to apply the encryption.

Clicking OK on the final dialog box will close the wallet. The next time you open it, you will be required to use your passphrase in order to send or stake your NIX, so do not lose your passphrase!

### Changing the QT Wallet passphrase

Once your wallet is encrypted, you can later change the passphrase if you wish. From the Settings menu, select "Change Passphrase..."

![Fill in your current passphrase and choose a new one](../../.gitbook/assets/qt-changepw.png)

## UI Wallet

The NIX UI Wallet is, by design, made to be both secure and user-friendly. It will prompt the user to set a password the first time it starts up.

Choose a strong password, check the box and click on "Encrypt Wallet". The wallet will then restart and allow you to use its normal interface.

### Changing the UI Wallet password

If you'd like to change your password, you may do so by first clicking on Settings from the menu on the left, and then on the Security. There you will find a "Change Password" button.
