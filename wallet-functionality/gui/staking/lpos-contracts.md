# LPoS Contracts

You can utilize the LPoS 'Leased Staking' tab to create both Cold Staking and Leased Proof of Stake smart contracts that operate in a trustless manner until you decide to cancel the contract. 

This means any coin owner can lease their staking rights to any third-party staking merchant \(who may charge a fee for their services\) to receive staking rewards without needing to worry about the technicalities of keeping a wallet open, updated and unlocked for staking. Such LPoS service providers can be found in the [NIX marketplace](https://nixplatform.io/marketplace).

As mentioned, there are 2 ways to use this smart contract:

**Independent Cold Staking -** After setting yourself up an [LPoS cold staking wallet](../../../support/lpos-server-setup.md), simply point the 'Lease to' address to an address generated by your server's wallet, specify an amount you wish to stake and click 'Send NIX'. You'll be required to input your encryption password.

**Using an LPoS Merchant -** Each merchant will provide all necessary information you'll need to create a contract with them. **Failure to properly enter the merchants provided information will result in your contract being unable to stake and earn rewards.**

## Creating a Contract

First, click on "Staking" in the left-hand menu, then "Leased staking" followed by "NEW LEASING CONTRACT"

**`LPoS provider details:`** Can be set to anything you like.

**`Address that coins will be leased to for staking:`** Defines the external address allowed to stake the coins. This address is supplied by the merchant.

**`Contract description:`** Can be set to anything you like.

**`LPoS provider's fee:`** Amount of reward share allocated to the leasing merchant. This info is provided by the merchant.

**`Address for LPoS provider's fee:`** The merchant's address for their share of the stake reward when your contract successfully stakes. This address is supplied by the merchant.

## Cancelling a Contract

At the bottom of the Leased Staking window, you'll find the active contracts list. Here, you can view details and cancel any of your LPoS contracts.
