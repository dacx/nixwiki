# Installation and Updating

When NIX Core has an available update the UI wallet will automatically download and install the daemon, making the latest version available for use the next time you run your wallet. 

When the GUI Wallet itself has an available update, a notification will appear in the "Updates" screen. These updates require the user to download and install the latest version from the [NIX website](https://nixplatform.io/wallet#download) or direct from [GitHub](https://github.com/NixPlatform/Nix-GUI/releases).
