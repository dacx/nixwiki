# Backup and Security

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING:** Your NIX coins are stored on the blockchain and your ability to move them depends on whether or not you have the private keys. If you lose your private keys, you lose control of your coins. It is strongly recommended that you backup your wallet.dat file.
