# Wallet Encryption

When first running your GUI wallet, you will be prompted to choose an encryption passphrase. Make sure it is a strong passphrase at least 10 characters long and that you keep a copy of it in a safe location \(not in a plain text file on your computer\). Losing this passphrase will result in your funds being forever locked in your wallet.
