description: How to Setup and Cancel an LPoS Contract
---

# LPoS Client

You can utilize the LPoS 'Create Contract' screen to create both Cold Staking and Leased Proof-of-Stake smart contracts that operate in a trustless manner until you decide to cancel the contract. 

This means any coin owner can lease their staking rights to any third-party staking merchant \(who may charge a fee for their services\) to receive staking rewards without needing to worry about the technicalities of keeping a wallet open, updated and unlocked for staking. Such LPoS service providers can be found in the [NIX marketplace](https://nixplatform.io/marketplace).

As mentioned, there are 2 ways to use this smart contract:

**Independent Cold Staking -** After setting yourself up an [LPoS cold staking wallet](lpos-server.md), simply point the 'Lease to' address to an address generated by your servers wallet, specify an amount you wish to stake and click 'Send NIX'. You'll be required to input your encryption password if one is set.

**Using an LPoS Merchant -** If a merchant doesn't charge a fee for their staking services, then the process is exactly the same as Cold Staking. If they do charge a fee then you'll need to click the 'Enable fee payout' box before being able to enter a Fee Percent and Reward Address. **Failure to properly enter the merchants provided information will result in your contract being unable to stake and earn rewards.**
