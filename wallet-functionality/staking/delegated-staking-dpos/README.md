**Lease to** defines the _external_ address allowed to stake the coins.

**Amount** operates as the same option in 'Send' and follows coin control.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check _'Enable fee payout'_ if the merchant requests a fee
{% endhint %}

**Fee Percent** is the proportion of the reward allocated to the leasing merchant. Leave disabled when delegating the staking to a VPS.

**Reward address** is the merchants cold address. the reward goes directly to the UTXO if the fund owner and the merchant can keep staking that.
