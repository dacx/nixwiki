# Wallet Staking

## QT Wallet

In order to stake your coins from the QT Wallet you must first [encrypt your wallet](../backup-and-security-1/qt-wallet-encryption.md). You cannot stake from a wallet that is not encrypted.

Simply select "Unlock For Staking..." from the Settings menu and enter in your wallet passphrase.

![Staking will show as &quot;Enabled&quot;](../../.gitbook/assets/qt-stakingenabled.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT:** You must leave your wallet open and "unlocked for staking" in order to actively stake your coins!
{% endhint %}

## UI Wallet

Staking with the UI Wallet is quite easy as well. Simply select "Staking" from the left-hand menu of the wallet and toggle the staking slider. You will then be prompted to enter in your passphrase.

**IMPORTANT:** You must leave your wallet open and "unlocked for staking" in order to actively stake your coins!
{% endhint %}

## Advanced Configuration

You can enact finer control over staking by using [Wallet staking options](../command-line-options.md#wallet-staking-options) in your nix.conf configuration file.
