# Backup and Security

## Backup and Recovery

Mobile wallets use a 12 word seed phrase that will be displayed once you first open/create your wallet. Simply write down the list of words and store them in a safe place. Without these words \(and in the proper order\), recovery is not possible. 

To view your seed phrase at any time, tap Menu.. Security Center.. Paper Key.

## Security

Security on mobile devises include both device level security along with in-app security options. Installing the app to a locked phone is highly recommended. Additionally, the app itself can further be secured with a 6 digit PIN and/or a Fingerprint ID. These in-app security settings can be found by tapping on Menu, then Security Center.
